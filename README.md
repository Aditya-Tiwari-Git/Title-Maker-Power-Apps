# Title-Maker-Power-Apps
The Ticket Title Maker for SD is a Power Apps project designed to streamline the process of generating and managing product-related titles. This app allows users to select a product, associated issues, and errors from searchable dropdown lists, then generate a formatted title string in the format of Product: Issue: Error. Service Desk can use it.

To build the "Ericsson Title Maker" Power App using your SharePoint list, follow these steps:

### **1. Set Up the SharePoint List**
Make sure your SharePoint list has the following columns:
- **Product**: Single line of text.
- **Issue**: Single line of text.
- **Error**: Single line of text.

Populate this list with your data. For example:

| Product   | Issue           | Error                |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Outlook   | Can't Send Email | Server Unavailable   |
| OneDrive  | Sync Issues      | File Locking Error   |
| Teams     | Login Failure    | Authentication Error |

### **2. Create the Power App**

#### **Step 1: Create a New Canvas App**

#### **Step 2: Add Data Source**

#### **Step 3: Add Drop-down Controls**

#### **Step 4: Set Up Drop-downs**

#### **Step 5: Add a Button to Copy and Clear**

#### **Step 6: Test the App**

### **3. Finalize and Publish**
- Once tested, publish your app so itâ€™s available for use.

Now, your Power App is ready for use! Users can select a Product, Issue, and Error, and copy them to the clipboard in the required format with a single click.
