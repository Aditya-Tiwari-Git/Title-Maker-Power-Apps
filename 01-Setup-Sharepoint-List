Setting up the SharePoint list is a crucial first step when creating a system for tracking issues related to products. This process involves creating and configuring a SharePoint list that will serve as a centralized repository for storing and managing data about various products, their associated issues, and any errors that occur. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to set up the SharePoint list:

### 1. **Create a New SharePoint List**

1. **Access Your SharePoint Site:**
   - Navigate to your SharePoint site using your web browser.
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage lists on the site.

2. **Navigate to the Site Contents:**
   - On the left-hand menu, click on "Site Contents."
   - This will take you to a page where you can view all existing lists, libraries, and other content on your SharePoint site.

3. **Create a New List:**
   - Click on the "New" button and select "List" from the dropdown menu.
   - This opens a dialog where you can name your list and provide a description if desired.
   - **Name the List**: Choose a descriptive name, such as "Product Issues Tracker."
   - **Description (Optional)**: Provide a brief description of the list's purpose, e.g., "This list tracks issues and errors for different products."
   - Click "Create" to generate the new list.
